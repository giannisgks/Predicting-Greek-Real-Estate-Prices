# Predicting Greek Real Estate Prices

This project explores the Greek residential property market using a comprehensive dataset of listings from **Attiki** and **Thessaloniki (2022)**. The goal is to uncover patterns in housing prices and build predictive models to estimate property values.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning & Visualization**  
  Explored and visualized key features to understand market behavior.

- **Clustering for Market Segmentation**  
  Applied clustering techniques to identify distinct real estate market segments.

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  Built models using:
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Measured performance using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score

## Key Insights

- Significant **regional variation** in property prices.
- Certain **property features** (e.g., area, location, condition) have a strong impact on value.
